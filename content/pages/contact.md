### If you'd like to contribute to development

You can always file a pull request or issue at [our github](https://github.com/llemr-conspiracy/llemr). If you have an idea and want to know if your PR would be accepted, you can feel free to file an issue, and mention that you'd be open to building out the feature yourself. We have an invite-only Slack where you'd be able to ask questions and so forth.

We accept help with all kinds of things, from writing new blog posts to making this website prettier! Reach out at `contact@llemrconspiracy.org`
