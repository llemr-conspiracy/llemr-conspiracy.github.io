Title: Contact

We're friendly and love to hear from folks who are considering or already using LLEMR.

### If you have found a security-impacting issue

Please **do not** file a pull request or otherwise post publically. Instead, email <security@llemrconsiracy.org>. Our PGP public key can be found [here]({static}/keys/publickey.security@llemrconspiracy.asc).

This is important because we want to avoid public disclosure of any vulnerabilities until after they are patched.

### If you'd implement LLEMR at your free clinic

Get it touch at <contact@llemrconsiracy.org>!

### If you'd like to contribute to development

You can always file a pull request or issue at [our github](https://github.com/llemr-conspiracy/llemr). If you have an idea and want to know if your PR would be accepted, you can feel free to file an issue, and mention that you'd be open to building out the feature yourself. We have an invite-only Slack where you'd be able to ask questions and so forth.

### If you'd like to talk about something else

We accept help with all kinds of things, from writing new blog posts to making this website prettier! Reach out at <contact@llemrconspiracy.org>.
